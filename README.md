## The assignment

We were tasked with using the Open Data to create a prototype that showcases something about Amsterdam.

## My Concept

I really liked the idea of showing buildings that don't exist anymore in Amsterdam. Initially the idea was to use simple markers, but I really wanted the buildings to be 3d objects. So I decided to use Mapbox & Three.js.
